This repository contains a package called ``cog_plot`` containing functions to generate the default plot types used in the cogitate papers.

It can generate three types of plots:

- Time series plot with statistical significance (``plot_time_series``)
- Matrices with statistical significance, such as time-frequency decomposition or temporal generalization (``plot_matrix``)
- Single trial data using a raster plot and a time series plot of the evoked response (``plot_raster``)

Setup guide:
============

The package can be installed via pip, like so:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install https://github.com/Cogitate-consortium/cog_plot
